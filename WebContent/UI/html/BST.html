		A binary search tree or a BST is a collection of nodes arranged in a
		way where they maintain BST properties. Each node has a key and an
		associated value. While searching, the desired key is compared to the
		keys in BST and if found, the associated value is retrieved. It is a
		binary tree in which data with lesser values are stored in left nodes
		and data with greater values is stored in right nodes. This
		characteristics provide for very efficient searches and holds for both
		numeric data and non-numeric data.
		<ul>
			<li>search --- in the worst case the search key is not found,
				but would be located next to the deepest leaf in the tree. Each step
				takes only a constant amount of work so the algorithm is O(h), where
				h is the height of the tree.</li>
			<li>insert --- in the worst case the insertion takes place at
				deepest leaf in the tree --- the algorithm is also O(h).</li>
			<li>delete --- the worst case is either the same as for search
				or occurs when the the delete key is found, but that node has two
				children and either the predecessor or successor of that key is
				located at the deepest leaf. In either case, the amount of work is
				bounded by O(h).</li>
